# Interests and Hobbies
- As an active member of [Ernte-Verein Donrath 1925 e.V.](https://www.evd-tanzfloehe.de/), I am part of a strong and vibrant community that keeps our club’s traditions alive. Together, we create memorable celebrations and preserve the customs that have shaped us for generations.
- I am a supporter of [1. FC Köln](https://fc.de/) and stand by my club through highs and lows.
- Every year on Veilchendienstag (Shrove Tuesday), I walk through Lohmar-Ort as part of [Ääzebär e.V. Lohmar](https://www.aeaezebaer.de/) and collect donations for a good cause. Most of the proceeds go to the Lohmar Red Cross that same evening, while the remaining funds are distributed to various clubs and initiatives across the city
